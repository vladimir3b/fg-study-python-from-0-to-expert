    You don't know how to be a man

    I open myself, you close me,
    I want to run, but you catch me again,
    I want to cry out, you tell me to shut up,
    Why do I do it?

    I throw myself, like a child
    I listen to you, pleasant, humble
    Why do I do it?
    Why don't I leave, why do I settle?

    I gave you power over me,
    I am strong but not this way, but not now
    When do I have to say it;
    How do I say it to you?

    You don't know how to be a man
    For a girl.
    You didn't even try,
    Not even once.
    My argument is mute,
    It's just for me.
    You don't know how to be a man
    And nobody teaches you how.
